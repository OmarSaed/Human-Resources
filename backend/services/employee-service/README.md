## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Repository Pattern
```typescript
// Base repository with common CRUD operations
abstract class BaseRepository<T extends BaseEntity>

// Specific repositories
class EmployeeRepository extends PrismaRepository<Employee>
class DepartmentRepository extends PrismaRepository<Department>
class PositionRepository extends PrismaRepository<Position>
```

### Service Layer
```typescript
// Business logic and orchestration
class EmployeeService
class DepartmentService
class PositionService
class AuditService
class NotificationService
```

### Controller Layer
```typescript
// HTTP request/response handling
class EmployeeController
class DepartmentController
class PositionController
```

### Event-Driven Integration
```typescript
// Publishes events to Kafka
EventFactory.publishEvent(EVENT_TYPE, data)

// Event types
- employee.created
- employee.updated
- employee.deleted
- department.created
- position.created
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema
